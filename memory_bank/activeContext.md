# Todo App Active Context

## Current Focus: Clean Code Refactoring (Ongoing)

We have made significant progress in refactoring the Todo application according to clean code principles. The major phases of the refactoring plan have been completed, with some additional tasks remaining.

### Completed Refactoring Tasks:

1. **Constants and Magic Numbers**
   - Created a dedicated constants.rs file with organized categories
   - Moved hardcoded values from components and utilities to constants
   - Used meaningful names and added comprehensive documentation

2. **Function Responsibility and Length**
   - Refactored the complex reorder() method in todo_list.rs into smaller functions
   - Added better naming with toggle_completion() instead of just toggle()
   - Improved organization of related functionality

3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling in storage.rs with detailed context
   - Added better error messages for debugging
   - Improved logging for desktop platforms

4. **Code Duplication**
   - Created theme utility module for consistent styling
   - Applied theme utilities to components
   - Extracted common patterns into reusable functions

5. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive test for reorder functionality
   - Improved function documentation throughout the codebase
   - Used better examples in documentation

### Remaining Refactoring Tasks:

1. Further component decomposition, especially in the larger components
2. Additional test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios
3. Final code review to identify any remaining duplication or inconsistencies

## Application Overview

The implementation currently includes:

1. A complete component structure for the Todo app
2. State management using Dioxus signals for reactive updates
3. UI implemented with Tailwind CSS
4. CRUD operations for todos
5. Local storage persistence
6. Filtering functionality
7. UI Refinements including animations, dark mode, and responsive design
8. Feature enhancements including due dates, tags, drag-and-drop, and search

## Components Implemented

- `TodoApp`: Main container component with signal-based state management
- `TodoForm`: Form for adding new todos using signals
- `TodoList`: Container for todo items with drag and drop reordering
- `TodoItem`: Individual todo item with completion toggle using signals
- `FilterBar`: Component for filtering todos by status
- `TagsFilter`: Component for filtering todos by tags/categories
- `SearchBox`: Component for searching todos by text
- `ThemeManager`: Component for managing dark/light mode
- `KeyboardShortcutsHandler`: Component for handling keyboard shortcuts

## Utilities Improved

- `constants.rs`: Centralized constants grouped by category
- `theme.rs`: Consistent theme utilities for UI styling
- `storage.rs`: Improved error handling and context

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining refactoring tasks
2. Proceed with deployment preparation

## Technical Decisions

- Used Dioxus signals for state management
- Implemented a clean, minimalist UI with Tailwind
- Stored todos in localStorage for persistence
- Used HashMap for efficient todo storage and retrieval
- Created modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Added comprehensive error handling with context
- Centralized constants and theme utilities

# Todo App System Patterns

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Structure
- Organize components with a clear hierarchy
- Create reusable components for common elements
- Maintain separation of concerns between components
- Use proper props and state management

### State Management
- Use Dioxus hooks for component-level state
- Implement global state for app-wide data
- Ensure reactive updates when state changes
- Keep state normalized and minimally duplicated

### Event Handling
- Use Dioxus event handlers consistently
- Implement proper event propagation
- Centralize event logic for common operations
- Document complex event interactions

## Code Patterns

### Component Naming
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Name components based on their purpose
- Prefix specific component types if needed
- Keep names concise but descriptive

### State and Props
- Define clear prop interfaces for all components
- Document required vs optional props
- Use appropriate data types for state variables
- Initialize state with sensible defaults

### Function Structure
- Keep component functions focused and single-purpose
- Extract complex logic to separate utility functions
- Use hooks for shared functionality
- Maintain consistent error handling

## Data Flow Patterns

### Parent-Child Communication
- Pass props from parent to child components
- Use callbacks for child-to-parent communication
- Document prop requirements clearly
- Validate props where appropriate

### Persistence
- Use local storage for saving todo items
- Implement consistent serialization/deserialization
- Handle storage errors gracefully
- Provide feedback for persistence operations

## UI Patterns

### Responsive Design
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for responsive layouts
- Test designs on multiple screen sizes
- Ensure accessible design for all users
- Implement mobile-first approach

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Provide visual feedback for user actions
- Use animations judiciously for better UX
- Implement proper loading/processing states
- Ensure consistent error messaging
